Dan's Book Finder (tm) is a MERN stack application designed to help you with all of your book finding needs. For more details, read more below!
## Installation
To install this application , download this repo to your local machine and install its dependencies with 'npm install'. This is not required though, you will fiund a deployed link in the next section. 
## Instructions
Click on this link to the deployed application:. Once you are there, type in the search bar to find any book of your choice. The Google API that has been implemented will return a list of books that match  your criteria. You will notice that there is a button to save this book to your list, but it will not work until you are logged in, which will require a profile to use. Go to the Login/Create User link at the  top right of the page to get started. Click on the create user option and add some credentials (you don't need real credentials, go crazy with it if that's your style).

Once you have created your profile, you will then be able to save books to a list, which can be found on the Saved Books page, which can be found on the top right of the page. Delete books from this list by clicking that shiny red delete button underneath each listing. Click on the logout button to logout, and that's about it!
